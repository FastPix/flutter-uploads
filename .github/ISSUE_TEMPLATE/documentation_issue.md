Here's how the documentation should be written:

      final signedUrl = await _signedUrlService.generateSignedUrl(
        metadata: {
          'uploadedBy': 'flutter_app',
          'fileType': 'video',
          'timestamp': DateTime.now().toIso8601String(),
        },
      );

      // Step 2: Configure and start upload
      final uploadService = FlutterResumableUploads.builder()
          .file(videoFile)
          .signedUrl(signedUrl)
          .chunkSize(16 * 1024 * 1024) // 16MB chunks
          .maxRetries(3)
          .enableLogging()
          .onProgress((progress) {
        print('Upload Progress: ${progress.uploadPercentage}%');
      })
          .onError((error) {
        print('Upload Error: ${error.message}');
      })
          .build();

      // Step 3: Start upload
      await uploadService.uploadVideo();
